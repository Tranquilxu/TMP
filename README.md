This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments from the paper ["Learning from True-False Labels via Multi-modal Prompt Retrieving"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15228). The paper propose a novel weakly supervised setting, True-False Label (TFL), which generates reliable labels using vision-language models. Besides, we introduce a risk-consistent method to learn from TFLs via multi-modal prompt retrieving.
